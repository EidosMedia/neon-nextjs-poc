# Next.js headless app with Cobalt example

## How to use

Download the example [or clone the repo](https://github.com/EidosMedia/neon-nextjs-poc):

Install it and run:

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

## The idea behind the example

The project uses [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js), and shows how it is possible to integrate it with [Eidosmedia Cobalt](https://www.eidosmedia.com/platforms/#cobalt) headless APIs.
It also includes `@mui/material` and its peer dependencies, in order to build a modern, responsive website - taking inspiration from the [Fortnightly](https://material.io/design/material-studies/fortnightly.html) MUI template.

**WARNING: this code is not meant to be used in production! Many implementations are done "quick & dirty": the goal is NOT to provide Next.js or React development best practices - the goal is only to illustrate how to interact with Cobalt APIs.**
